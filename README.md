The ten bar truss is a classic optimization problem. In this problem,
I find the optimal cross-sectional areas for each beam in the ten-bar 
truss.

The objective of the optimization is to minimize the mass of the
structure, subject to the constraints that every segment does not yield
in compression or tension
